## Description
This is an implementation of the NodeJS monolithic architecture I have written about on my [website](https://salmanahmad94.com/archives/nodejs) in a series of articles.

## Getting started
Clone the project onto your local machine. Make sure you have NodeJS installed. 

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Set the env
Make a .env file and set the environment variables as the .env.example file according to your preferences. 

### Start the app in development mode

```
npm run dev
```
